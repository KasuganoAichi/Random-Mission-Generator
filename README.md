# Random-Mission-Generator
Tool to create the base for random missions, while it's made to be used with Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, the .txt files can be changed by the user, thus it can be used for any sort of random mission generator. There are more complete ones that can generate a mission with all it's details on the internet, this is just my simple version of that, for those who like to create every bit of it, or just want to have a quick mission for it's players.
